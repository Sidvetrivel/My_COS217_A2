What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

- The course's lectures.
- The course's precepts.
- The course's website.
- Documents that are referenced directly by the course's website. 
  Such documents include the course's lecture slides and precept 
  handouts.
- The course's current staff members outside of class time through 
  office hours.
- The course's current staff members outside of class time through 
  meetings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This was a very challenging assignment but not often the most 
complicated. There was a lot of tedious debugging and a lot of back and
forth iteration. It certainly reinforced my understanding of pointers
because I was still a bit iffy on how to use them prior to this 
assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I was able to complete the stra.c implentation of Str_search and it 
passes all the tests within teststr. However, after hours and hours of
back and forth iteration when implementing the same thing in strp.c, I 
ended up with a segmentation fault even though I passed all the 
boundary and statement tests. Hopefully I can get a lot of partial 
credit on the challenge portion of my assignment because I already have
one implentation that fully works and another that is almost there in 
terms of functionality.

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

for stra.c, I got one splint warning:

stra.c: (in function Str_compare)
stra.c:51:12: Return value type char does not match declared type int:
                 (str1[i] - pcSrc[i])
  To make char and int types equivalent, use +charint.

I think this change is not neccesary because the value will get casted
to an int when being returned from the function anyway and doesn't 
affect the final functionality of the compare function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

Using splint, my code generated one warning:

strp.c: (in function Str_compare)
strp.c:45:12: Return value type char does not match declared type int:
                 (*(char *)str1) - (*(char *)str2)
  To make char and int types equivalent, use +charint.

The suggestion made by splint is uneccessary in this case because the
return type char gets automatically casted to an int when returned and
the functionality of the code doesn't get affected by this so it is
uneccessary to change this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

for replace.c, splint outputted these similar warnings:

These warnings can be ignored because these functions are definied 
in the source files which is linked through the str.h file so it doesn't
need to be defined in any other place besides the source file itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

I had one warning on replace.c:
str.h:6:8: Function Str_getLength declared but not defined
str.h:10:7: Function Str_copy declared but not defined
str.h:14:7: Function Str_concat declared but not defined
str.h:18:5: Function Str_compare declared but not defined
str.h:23:7: Function Str_search declared but not defined

Checking replace.c

   str.h: line 1: high priority: 
   A file should begin with a comment.

This seems uneccessary as not every file needs to have the first line 
be a comment even though I agree that it certainly doesnt hurt to have
a comment in the first line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No it is not possible because we don't know the 
size of the desitnation buffer for both functions at compile time and
using the assert statement would not be an way appropriate to validate 
if there is enough space because the statement would execute at 
runtime. This means that we can't actually use assert to find if we have
enough destination memory at compile time which is what we want.
